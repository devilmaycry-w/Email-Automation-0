## 🛠️ How Does CodexCity Work? (Step-by-Step Flow)

1. **User Onboards and Logs In**  
   Users sign up and log in through a simple, secure interface (using Supabase Auth). After logging in, they land on a clean, responsive dashboard.

2. **Connect SendGrid**  
   Users enter their SendGrid API key and (optionally) choose their verified sender/domain.  
   The app securely stores this information, allowing users to send emails through their own business domain or the project default one.

3. **Create and Manage Email Templates**  
   Users can create, edit, and save multiple email templates for common scenarios (e.g., order confirmation, support reply, general update).  
   Templates include fields for subject and body, with support for dynamic placeholders (like customer name or order number).

4. **Send Emails Effortlessly**  
   Users select a template, fill in recipient details, and send the email with a single click.  
   CodexCity uses the SendGrid API to deliver emails instantly and reliably.

5. **Track Email Activity**  
   Every sent email is logged in a Supabase database, including:
   - Recipient email  
   - Template used  
   - Timestamp  
   - Delivery status (success/failure)  
   Users can view their email history in the dashboard for transparency and compliance.

6. **Polished, Professional Experience**  
   The dashboard is styled with Tailwind CSS for a premium, modern look.  
   A “Powered by CodexCity” badge in the footer reinforces trust and brand identity.
